# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis---Python
## Skills - Python, Data Cleaning, EDA, Visualization


This project investigates the **high cancellation rates** observed at both City Hotel and Resort Hotel. Through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, the goal is to identify key factors influencing cancellations and provide **data-driven recommendations** to help hotels optimize revenue, improve room utilization, and reduce booking cancellations.

**Key Analysis Areas:**

- What are the **key variables** that affect hotel reservation cancellations?  
- How can we **reduce the cancellation rate** through actionable insights?  
- How can hotels use this analysis to improve **pricing strategies and promotions**?

**Techniques & Tools Used:**

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, corrected data types, and ensured dataset consistency  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examined patterns in cancellation rates, booking status, and monthly ADR  
- **Feature Exploration:** Focused on factors such as lead time, market segment, booking changes, reservation status date and average daily rate (ADR)  
- **Visualization:** Used graphical techniques to uncover hidden patterns and support findings

**Libraries:**

- `Pandas` for data handling and analysis  
- `NumPy` for numerical operations  
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualization

**Key Insights Discovered:**

- **37% of bookings** were cancelled across both hotel types  
- **City Hotel** had a **lower average daily rate (ADR)** compared to Resort Hotel  
- **January** showed the highest number of cancellations  
- **August** had **highest bookings** also had **lower cancellation rates**  
- **ADR (pricing)** showed a significant impact on the likelihood of cancellations  

**Skills Gained:**

- Conducted real-world **EDA on a hospitality dataset**  
- Learned to interpret key business metrics such as **ADR, lead time, and cancellation rate**  
- Developed **data storytelling skills** through visual analysis  
- Strengthened knowledge of **Python libraries** like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib  
- Built a strong foundation for future **predictive modeling** to forecast cancellations
